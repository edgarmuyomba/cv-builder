# CV Builder

This is a simple resume builder or generator as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-cv-application) react exercises. The project allows users to enter information about their bio, work and education history and uses a predefined template to generate a resume. This resume can then be downloaded at the user's convenience.

You can checkout the live demo [here](https://edgarmuyomba.github.io/cv-builder)
